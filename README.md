# Multi-Modal Graph Attention Network for Image Captioning

This project implements a state-of-the-art image captioning system using Multi-Modal Graph Attention Networks (MMGAT). The system combines grid-based visual features, region-based object detection, and semantic understanding to generate accurate and contextually relevant image descriptions.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Grid Graph Feature Extraction**
   - Extracts visual features from image patches using a Swin Transformer
   - Constructs a grid-based graph representation of the image

2. **Region Graph Feature Extraction**
   - Uses Faster R-CNN for object detection and feature extraction
   - Implements multi-head attention for region feature refinement

3. **Semantic Graph Feature Extraction**
   - Processes text using BERT embeddings
   - Constructs semantic graphs using dependency parsing
   - Applies graph convolutional networks for feature refinement

4. **Multi-Modal Aggregation**
   - Grid-Semantic Aggregator: Combines grid and semantic features
   - Region-Grid Aggregator: Integrates region and grid features
   - Semantic-Semantic Aggregator: Refines semantic relationships

5. **Transformer Decoder**
   - Generates captions using a transformer-based decoder
   - Implements multi-head attention and position-wise feed-forward networks

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from multi_modal_graph_attention import MultiModalGraphAttention
from transformer_decoder import MMGATImageCaptioning

# Initialize the model
model = MMGATImageCaptioning(
    vocab_size=10000,
    d_model=512,
    num_heads=8,
    num_layers=6
)

# Generate caption for an image
image = load_image("path/to/image.jpg")
caption = model.generate_caption(image)
```

### Training

```python
# Training setup
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        images, captions = batch
        outputs = model(images, captions)
        loss = criterion(outputs, captions)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
